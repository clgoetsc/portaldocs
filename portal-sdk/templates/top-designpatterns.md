# Design patterns for common Azure scenarios

These design patterns provide solutions for common scenerios in Azure.  In Azure, we formalize these best practices once several teams have a similar problem, use a well researched shared approach, and see successful real-world usage of the common solution. Azure teams should leverage these design patterns to accelerate extension development and to provide users with a familiar experience so that users can easily adopt new Azure services.

The following patterns are available

# Resource Management
The resource management patterns provide guidance for managing the full lifecycle of Azure resources.

1. Resource Create [designpatterns-resource-create.md](designpatterns-resource-create.md)

2. Resource Browse [designpatterns-resource-browse.md](designpatterns-resource-browse.md)

3. Resource Manage [designpatterns-resource-manage.md](designpatterns-resource-manage.md)


# Page 
The page patterns provide guidance for common page layouts in Azure

## Page design recommendations
* Pages should be `fullscreen`
* Each page that is displaying data should have a `Refresh` button

## Page patterns
1. Fullscreen [designpatterns-page-fullscreen.md](designpatterns-page-fullscreen.md)

2. Page with lists [designpatterns-page-grid.md](designpatterns-page-grid.md)

3. Forms [designpatterns-page-forms.md](designpatterns-page-forms.md)


# Design toolkits and resources
Design toolkits and resources are available so that you can easily create designs that leverage these patterns

* Design toolkits [designpatterns-toolkits.md](designpatterns-toolkits.md)

* Style guide [designpatterns-style-guide.md](designpatterns-style-guide.md)

* Icons [designpatterns-icons.md](designpatterns-icons.md)
